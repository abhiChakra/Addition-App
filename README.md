# Addition-App
Code for a two-part Medium article series covering the steps to developing and deploying a web-application. In this two-article series, we will build a simple Addition web-application with a React-Nginx Web-server and Flask-WSGI Application-server. We will then Dockerize and deploy the application on Google Kubernetes Engine.
